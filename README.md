## Introduction
This is a Power BI project on the performance and sales analysis of **Coca Cola Beverages Analysis**. The project is to analyze sales performance across time, different brands, retailers, products and regions in order to provide data driven insights for decisions making in sales strategy, marketing and supply chain management.
## Problem Statement:
1. Which products are top-performing and which ones are underperforming in terms of revenue and sales volume?
2. Which brands contribute the most to our overall revenue, and how does each compare?
3. Which retailers are driving the highest sales volumes, and which ones may need attention or support?
4. How do our sales fluctuate across different months, and are there any seasonal trends or patterns we should be aware of?
